# Detecting-Anomaly-Activity-in-IoT-Networks-Using-Deep-Learning-Based-Model
Network intrusion detection systems are designed to assess diverse network data through behavioural analysis of the network in order to maintain its security. 
For the classification of traffic into multiclass and binary classes, a deep learning-based model is used. 
The URL to the datasets we are using is here. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E8CSTmwCcDGN4dA29Y0TdY2LetVaVW10?usp=sharing
IOT_DS2.ipynb should be executed first, followed by Instrusion.ipynb. Due to the size of the dataset, the training procedure takes a long time.
